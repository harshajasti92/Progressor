<h3><em>Old age</em> refers to ages nearing or surpassing the life expectancy of human beings and is thus the end of the human life cycle. Terms and euphemisms include old people (worldwide usage), seniors (American usage), senior citizens (British and American usages), older adults (in the social sciences), the elderly, and elders (in many cultures�including the cultures of aboriginal people) besides this the newest term being associated with old age is <a href="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/GpEAAOSwQaFawoPe/s-l300.jpg"> <em><strong>�Harsha Jasti�</strong></em></a> this is done for self-explanatory reasons.
Old people often have limited regenerative abilities and are more susceptible to disease, syndromes, injuries and sickness than younger adults. The organic process of ageing is called senescence, the medical study of the aging process is called gerontology and the study of diseases that afflict the elderly is called geriatrics. The elderly also face other social issues around retirement, loneliness, and ageism.
